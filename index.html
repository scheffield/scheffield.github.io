          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>I just recently started working on my second quadrupedal rebot build. The first one turned out to be heaps of fun to design and program but ultimately failed to walk which was the goal.</p>
          <p>With the second incarnation I want to improve the sturdiness of the body and the legs and I would love to build in encoders to track the leg positions. I also want to design my own PCB to make the electornics lighter and more suitable for the task.</p>
          <p>This time arround however, the focus is on planning and researching to be able to come up with a design that works much better and that I can use to further develop the platform.</p>
